# Devolio (WIP)

The project is very new and code quality is not the best.

## Run on Docker
First make sure docker is running and then do:

1. `docker build -t devolio/devolio .` or `make bd`
2. `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 devolio/devolio` or `make rd`
3. [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

**Currently it just shows a boring welcome page. More to come soon.**
